# Overview

In the game Old School Runescape (OSRS), your player has a health bar. This can be refilled by eating food ([list of all foods](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Food/All_food)), for example a lobster heals your character for 12 hitpoints (HP):

Additionally, OSRS contains a player to player auction house called The Grand Exchange (GE). Items can be sold and bought asynchronously, with players setting a price then their buy/sell order being fulfilled when somebody matches their offer.

Websites such as the [OSRS wiki prices page](https://prices.runescape.wiki/osrs/item/379) have created ways for players to track the average prices of items. 

The goal of this project is to create my own database, storing the historical prices of all tradeable foods in OSRS, so that I can find the cheapest way to heal myself in game.
